<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_report_bugs_and_send_patches">Report bugs and send patches</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>Open-source code review is the heart of our process. We welcome bug
reports and fix patches. We&#8217;ll be happy to work with casual contributors,
casual contributors who want to become regulars, and regulars who aspire
to join the core team.  See our <a href="channels.html">Communications
channels</a> page to find the bugtracker and mailing lists.</p></div>

<div class="paragraph"><p>The core team can&#8217;t be everywhere, nor can we cover every operating
system and hardware platform collaboration.  If the POSIX/C99 build
breaks in your special environment, consider working with us as

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph"><p>NTP is critical infrastructure that has fallen into disrepair.
There&#8217;s a lot of work that needs to be done on it.  The core
team has the skills and experience to get the job done, but
it&#8217;s going to take many person-years of concentrated attention
to get it done - beyond the limit of what unpaid voluntarism
can sustain.  Also, some of the test hardware we need is
specialized and expensive.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Accurate time is the beating pulse of the Internetted world economy.
If you are a business or government agency or wealthy individual that
relies on the Internet, you rely on NTP.</p></div>
<div class="paragraph"><p>Please give generously - the civilization you save may be your own.</p></div>
